              In order to keep conference attendees safe, DjangoCon US will have an indoor mask mandate, a required proof of negative COVID test, and a vaccine verification process in-person in San Diego as well as an online verification before the conference. If you are not familiar, we suggest you check out the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html">CDC's Domestic Travel guidelines to stay safe</a>.
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>Update:</strong> On September 1, the CDC officially <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/s0901-covid-19-booster.html">recommended the new bivalent boosters</a> from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech. Based on these recommendations, we are now requiring one of the two conditions to be met:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  If it has been fewer than 5 months since you have completed your initial vaccination schedule
                  (2 doses for either Pfizer or Moderna or 1 dose for Johnson and Johnson or Novavax in the USA),
                  you are not required to get an additional booster.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you have received any booster since you have completed your initial vaccination schedule,
                   you are not required to get an additional booster at this time.
                  </li>
                <li>
                  Otherwise, you are required to get a COVID booster if it is available in your country of residence.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <br />
              <br />
              We are also requiring a negative test before coming to the registration desk on your first day of attendance. If you are taking a PCR test, it must be within 3 days of your first ticketed day (e.g. if you are attending a tutorial, the test must be taken no earlier than Thursday, October 11). If you are taking a rapid test that offers results in under 24 hours, you must take it within 24 hours of your first ticketed day.
              <br />
              <br />
              For vaccine verification, we will be using <a href="https://sharemy.health/">Share My Health</a>, a third-party vendor recognized as a leader in the space, which PyCon US 2022 also used. In order to pass the vaccine verification, you must have be up to date on your vaccine (including eligible boosters). We will be sending the instructions to in-person ticket-holders to verify your vaccine status prior to the conference.
              <br />
              <br />
              The conference will provide KN95 and/or N95 masks for people to wear. We will be asking that all attendees wear a certified KN95 / N95 respirator mask (with no outflow vent) while inside. As N95 is an American standard, masks certified by other governments to similar standards (e.g. PM2.5 and KF94) will also be allowed.
              <br />
              <br />
              Similar to PyCon US 2022, we will have a three strike policy for masks not being worn inside the venue. If you are seen without a mask on, you will be issued a strike by the organizing committee. Upon receiving your third strike, you will not be allowed to enter the venue and will not be issued a refund. Please make our job easy and keep your mask on while inside at all times.
              <br />
              <br />
              Speakers will be allowed to remove their masks while speaking at the lectern. This includes tutorial presenters, but presenters will need to put their masks back on while helping students as that typically requires being close enough to read their screens.
              <br />
              <br />
              If you have questions about the COVID-19 policy, please <a href="mailto:{{site.contact_us_email}}">email us</a>. If you need a medical exemption or the like, sending us an email is also the right course of action. If you are not interested in attending in person due to the mask and vaccine requirements, you are welcome to book an <a href="{{site.ticket_link}}">online ticket</a>.
