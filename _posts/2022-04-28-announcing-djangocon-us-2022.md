Hello, everyone!
We are very excited to announce that the website for DjangoCon US 2022 is [live](https://2022.djangocon.us).
Many thanks to [YupGup](http://yupgup.com/) for the website.
It looks amazing!

This year the conference will be from October 16-21.

- October 16: Tutorials ($195 per tutorial)
- October 17, 18, &amp; 19: Talks
- October 20 &amp; 21: Sprints

This year we will be returning to the [Marriott of Mission Valley](https://2022.djangocon.us/venue/) in San Diego, CA.
Tickets are [on sale now](https://ti.to/defna/djangocon-us-2022) and our [hotel block is open](https://bit.ly/2UZ0oQQ).
We sold out in 2019, so take advantage of our early bird pricing!

We will open our [opportunity grant](https://2022.djangocon.us/opportunity-grants/) (formerly financial aid) application on **OPPORTUNITY_GRANT_DEADLINE**.

Now is the time to start getting your submissions for talks and tutorials ready because the [call for proposals (CFP)](https://2022.djangocon.us/speaking/) will open on **CFP_DEADLINE**.
We look forward to seeing all of the prospective talks and tutorials!
