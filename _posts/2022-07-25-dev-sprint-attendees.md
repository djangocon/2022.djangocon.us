## What even IS a Development Sprint?
*(In the ancient days of FLOSS...)*
Sprints are most common around **F**ree/**L**ibre **O**pen **S**ource **S**oftware, or [FLOSS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_terms_for_free_software) projects. Most of these projects (like Django and Python) are built and maintained by a community of volunteers. These volunteers work together while being spread around the world. Conferences like DjangoCon US presented rare occasions for groups of these developers to be in the same place at the same time. And thus were born: Development Sprints!

Over time, these core developers realized sprints provided them an opportunity to help find *new* contributors. And that's where YOU come in.
