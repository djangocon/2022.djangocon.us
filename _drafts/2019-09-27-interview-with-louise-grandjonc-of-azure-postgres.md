title: "An Interview With Speaker Louise Grandjonc from the Azure Postgres Team"
---

The week before DjangoCon US, Python developer and [Azure Postgres engineer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/postgresql/quickstart-create-server-database-portal){:rel="sponsored"} Louise Grandjonc (who joined Microsoft by way of the Citus Data acquisition) sat down for an interview with Claire Giordano. Louise explains technical topics in a way that makes sense—and she often uses unusual (and fun) examples, from crocodiles to owls, from Harry Potter to Taylor Swift. Here’s an edited transcript of Claire Giordano’s interview with Python developer and Postgres expert Louise Grandjonc ([@louisemeta](https://twitter.com/louisemeta){:rel="sponsored"}). Enjoy.
