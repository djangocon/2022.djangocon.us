I am a Brazilian software developer that loves to architect systems, create new DevTools, and automate processes. I am a backend developer that loves developing systems using Python or Ruby. 🐍 💎

I am truly passionate about sharing knowledge and connecting with people. For the last couple of years, I’ve been focusing increasingly on open source. Open source is where I could find the perfect fit between people connection and coding in my day-to-day. As a result of this effort, my GitHub profile was the first one to be accepted for the GitHub Sponsors program in Brazil, which made me incredibly happy.

Finally, I am an open-source advocate that does believe in the power of tech communities. People > Tech 💜
