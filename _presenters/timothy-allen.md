Tim joined [Wharton Research Data Services](https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu) in 2008, after working for local companies and starting a few of his own. Having started programming at age six, he is currently an organizer of the Philadelphia Python Users Group, Code for Recovery, and a member of the Python Software Foundation and Django Software Foundation. Tim enjoys playing very loud guitar with lots of pedals, is an avid cyclist, was [the first person to sell real world items for virtual microcurrency](https://www.mtv.com/news/g3te5b/finally-you-can-buy-something-real-with-play-money) long before Bitcoin, and enjoys beating his head against brick walls (as demonstrated by his passion for coding, cycling in Philadelphia, and never-ending quest to get his cat to behave). A life-long Philadelphia resident, he graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1996 with an individualized major, “Computer Aided Information Acquisition”.
