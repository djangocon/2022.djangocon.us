Mr. Jiten Sidhpura recently earned his bachelor's degree in computer engineering (2022) and is currently employed as a full-time Software Engineer with JPMorgan Chase & Co in Mumbai, India. He obtained a summer internship through JPMC's Code For Good Hackathon and later got promoted to full-time employment based on his performance. His interests include web development, machine learning, and deep learning. He was one of the lead developers of [Sourceable](http://sourceable.info/), a Columbia University, New York, based startup that focuses on news related to Human rights violations, currently running as a pilot project in Bal-Al Hawa Borders of Syria. His final-year project, FedSpam, a privacy-preserving on-device Federated Learning Mobile Application to detect spam messages, won his college's best Project Exhibition Award. His research interests in Machine Learning prompted him to write research papers that got approved at an [IEEE](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9744191) Conference and the second paper is in the process of getting published in a Springer Book Series. In his sophomore year, he led a team of 5 students and developed a Fire Safety Awareness Mobile Application, which got recognized by the Fire & Security Association of India (FSAI).
