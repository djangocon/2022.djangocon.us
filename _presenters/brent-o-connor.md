Brent O'Connor is a co-founder and Director of Engineering at Canopy, a Public Benefit Company, which builds data management
and reporting software for government organizations. He helped start Canopy from its humble beginning to what has now
grown into a talented team of engineers, client success staff, and administrators who love working together.

Before working for Canopy, Brent had fun (and sometimes ~~pain~~challenges) building an array of websites, from a social
network to a CMS for a newspaper in Washington. During the early days of the web, he even built his own web Framework.

Outside of work, Brent loves doing things with family or just kicking back playing video games and watching movies.
