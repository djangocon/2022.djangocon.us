I am a full-stack developer who primarily has worked in Django, Flask, and FAST API as the backend, ReactJS in the front end, and AWS/GCP in the cloud.

I am two times failed entrepreneur, who had tried to set up two companies in the past. The first one was a digital publishing company where I tried to create a platform where anyone can share their experience-based learning with some paid articles/series on our platform i.e. HappyChases, and the second was a Data Science Company with my friends, we used to build Data Science Products for Entreprises, Startups, Govt bodies i.e. Codevector Labs (PS: I was one of the core members of the company, and one of our product that I lead end to end got Nascomm gamechanger award in AI by Nasscom), before joining Goldcast Inc last year as a Backend Engineer.

I am still exploring and seeking to resume my entrepreneurial journey soon if I feel enough confident about the idea. Currently, I am working as a Backend Engineer cum SRE at Goldcast.
