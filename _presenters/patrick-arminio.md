¬°Hello there! I'm Patrick, a Swiss-Italian living in London.

I'm currently mainly working on Strawberry üçì, a modern Python library for GraphQL. I'm a huge fan of GraphQL and also a Python user for more than 10 years now, so I'm super excited to contribute to the GraphQL ecosystem in Python.

I'm also the Chair of Python Italia, the association that organises events around Python in Italy, I'm currently working on the new website for the conference with some friends.
