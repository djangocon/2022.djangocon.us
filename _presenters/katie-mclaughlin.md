Katie has worn many different hats over the years. She has been a software developer for many languages, systems administrator for multiple operating systems, and speaker on many different topics.

She is currently a Developer Advocate for Google Cloud, where she helps improve the experience of the platform for Python and Django developers. 

When sheâ€™s not changing the world, she enjoys cooking, making tapestries, and seeing just how well various application stacks handle emoji.
