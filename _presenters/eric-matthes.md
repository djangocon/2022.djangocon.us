Eric is best known in the Python world as the author of Python Crash Course. Eric was a math and science teacher for 25 years, and taught programming whenever he could find a way to fit it into the curriculum. Eric is a full time writer and programmer now, and enjoys simplifying things for people who are learning, and for everyone else as well. When he's not writing or programming, he's probably outside with his family or involved in some kind of mountain rescue operation.
