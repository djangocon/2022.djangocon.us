I’m co-founder of Octobot, a software development company, where I currently work as CTO. ​As the technical leader, my goal is to help our team and company get better at delivering the products and services our clients need. 

I have experience and operational expertise in the IT industry, developed over 10 years working on projects for more than 20 clients in the US and Latin America. I've also had the opportunity to mix my deep interest in computer architecture and networks with my teaching passion, working as an assistant professor for 8 years at my alma mater. 

I enjoy being the father of two little and adorable kids, as well as football and hoppy beers.
