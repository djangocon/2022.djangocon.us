Chad Carlson manages the Developer Relations team at Platform.sh. Chad spent a large
portion of his professional career in academia, where he worked primarily in vision
science laboratories using Python to study the human visual system: how we detect
motion, how we understand natural image statistics, and its evolutionary origins.
Today he can typically be found writing, cooking, or working on projects in Python,
Node.js, Go, and whatever new language Platform.sh starts support for and wants
another pair of eyes on.
