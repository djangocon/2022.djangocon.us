Mario started learning Python at the very young age of 39, with hardly any previous programming experience. That was three and a half years ago. Since then, he's launched Python By Night&mdash;a blog detailing the journey of learning Python when there's just not enough time during the day&mdash;as well as presented a tutorial at PyCon US 2022.
