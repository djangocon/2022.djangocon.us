abstract: The Django Admin is a great low code tool for basic CRUD actions. However,
  it can do much more than that. While the Django Admin shouldn’t be used as your
  user facing web app, it can be a game changer for your internal team. Whether the
  goal is to empower the Support team or move away from risky raw SQL statements,
  the Django Admin can be customized to meet the need. Throughout this talk, I will
  share ways you can supercharge the Admin’s “batteries included” functionality and
  get the most from this out-of-the-box tool. This talk is best suited for people
  that have a bit of experience with Django, but experience with the Django Admin
  is not necessary.

We’ll start out simple by speeding up search results for big models so you can traverse through 40 million row tables in seconds. We’ll continue on and gain a deeper understanding of the `clean`, `save_model` and the `__init__` functions as these functions are where a lot of customization happens in the Admin. I’ll show you how to use multiple databases within one Admin website and even customize the basic Admin templates so you can have documentation right there on the CRUD pages.

By the end of the talk, you’ll have a new mindset and a toolkit for how to customize the Django Admin to your unique needs.

If you attend this talk, you’ll walk away with the following:
 - An understanding of how key functions work behind the scenes
 - The ability to go a step beyond the basic out-of-the-box setup and functionality
 - Confidence that you can implement custom features for your team
 - A sense of excitement about the Django Admin!
 - A new mindset for how to customize the Django Admin to your needs
