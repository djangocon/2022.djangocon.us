abstract: Our team of two front-end and six backend-stack engineers needed to build
  a web application that consisted of 60 complex and simple, pages and forms on a
  tight deadline. We knew we couldn’t meet our deadline by building a SPA, so we opted
  to use Vue and Django in a Hybrid type approach that would allow our back-end engineers
  to render Vue components from Django templates.

track: t2

In this talk, we’ll discuss our rationale for choosing this approach over other approaches like XHTML, etc. We’ll then dive into some code and show what exactly we mean by a Hybrid of Vue and Django. Then we’ll discuss some of the lessons we learned and what we might do differently next time.

We hope that those that attend this talk would walk away feeling inspired to try things that leverage the strengths of your team and the best features of the technologies in your toolbox.
