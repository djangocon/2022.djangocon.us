abstract: A common Django project bad practice is serializing ORM objects without
  properly loading relationships, causing N+1 query issues. Django don´t have an obvious
  way to avoid that, but some techniques and libs can help to produce better code
  without too many unnecessary queries.

Django don´t have an obvious way to avoid N+1 queries during objects serialization and it is easy to miss the right way in large projects.

This talk aims to show how I joined a project with a rudimentary serialization solution and improved it to be able to handle serializations without causing N+1 queries by accident, using django-qserializer (I'm the author).

I will discuss other solutions, how to do that with plain Django, how DRF do the same thing, how other libs can contribute or make your code worse.
