abstract: While astronomy and the study of the sky and Universe have been explored
  within a variety of global and cultural contexts, we tend to only see Western/Eurocentric
  astronomies in the classroom. Canada is built on Indigenous lands, on the erasure
  of Indigenous Knowledges and the attempted genocides of Indigenous peoples (Simpson,
  2014). In the era of Truth and Reconciliation, there is an increased need for Indigenous
  Knowledges of astronomy to be seen and understood at all levels of education. This
  has resulted in much interest from both settler and Indigenous educators to be inclusive
  of Indigenous Astronomy Knowledges (IAK) in the classroom, but many teachers do
  not know where, or how, to even begin. In this talk, we will be debuting “Astrodigenous”,
  a newly developed online portal which provides teachers and educators with search-like
  access to a wealth of Indigenous sky-knowledge resources. Our presentation will
  provide an overview of the resources we've collected, a tour of the core features
  of our website, and demonstrate the functionality and utility of our search engine.
  We will highlight how our choice of Django as a web framework has uniquely facilitated
  the rapid development of effective web applications and database modelling for our
  portal. We will also describe new materials we have developed to guide settler K-12
  teachers in exploring their own positionality with respect to the resources in our
  database and towards mindfully holding space for Indigenous Knowledge in their classrooms.
