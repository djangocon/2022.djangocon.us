abstract: "We developed a game in Unity3D to teach astronomy to undergraduates at
  Penn State University, which has since been adopted at several other universities.
  In this talk, I'd like to tell you about our journey using Django to track student
  progress through our game and some lessons we learned along the way:\r\n\r\n1. Test
  early and often! This won't be a talk about TDD or demanding high test coverage.
  We want to share the testing philosophy that worked for us: test enough to make
  you confident to change and deploy your code.\r\n2. Managing infrastructure. Many
  developers (myself included) find dealing with infrastructure daunting. I'd like
  to share how we iterated on our infrastructure processes to improve them over time,
  moving from a documented manual process to infrastructure as code.\r\n3. Using Django
  Rest Framework and (vanilla) Django for specific use cases. \r\n\r\nI hope that
  sharing the areas we struggled with and succeeded will help inform your next Django
  project!"

This talk is for anyone interested in using Django. Since I will cover the beginning of our journey, no prior Django knowledge is needed to get something from this talk. It will help to know the basics of web development and Django, but this knowledge is not required. I also hope more experienced developers will learn something from the lessons we'll share.
