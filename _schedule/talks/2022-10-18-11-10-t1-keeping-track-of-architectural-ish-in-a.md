abstract: "More often than not, keeping track of decisions made in the context of
  software development isâ€¦ challenging. Many developers have faced picking up seemingly
  well-documented projects where the rationale for a decision is, at best, available...
  somewhere. If you keep thinking about it, you might find something is odd. Is it
  actually that hard? Are we using the right tools?\r\n\r\nWe will present Architectural
  Decision Records, a (not so) novel approach that tries to capture that rationale
  in a lightweight and unobtrusive way. We will introduce the concept, go through
  some fundamentals and present a sample case from our experience and how it has reshaped
  our decision making."

In this talk, we will be presenting one way to keep track of decisions made in the context of software development. 

That certainly reads like a very short talk, yet, how is it that there is no abundance of examples about this in the software development world? Why is it that this seemingly simple and mundane thing is so seldom neglected? Is it that burdensome 8 pages long technical decision template that is getting in the way? 

For a while now, some have stated that the problem is the lack of a suitable method and have proposed some new ways to do so. Architectural Decision Records is one of those and from our experience, it's a breeze to work with. Most importantly, they have shaped the decision process to provide more thoughtful decisions with almost the same amount of effort.

We will be covering:
- A bit about the problem and the motivation for alternatives.
- Understanding what an Architecture Decision is (spoiler: less transcendental and more flexible than many think).
- The lightweight process of deciding with an ADR
- Example based on a case!

This talk requires no prior knowledge and welcomes all seniorities. If you have faced the problem before and you are not familiar with the concept of an ADR, this intro talk might provide some new tools on how to improve your decision and documentation process.
