abstract: Django HTML templates help to implement UI code in a consistent manner.
  With stateful session management, security, and ease of data transfer to the UI
  layer. However, there are cases, when you would want a partial request, instead
  of a full request reloading the page. This can be achieved with HTMX and Alpine.js
  integrated into Django HTML templates. This session will present a practical CRUD
  app. With Tailwind CSS we will make it look modern and usable.

After evaluating various toolkits and frameworks for UI development, I decided to go with Django. This choice was made for various reasons - Python backend, Django HTML templates, included security infrastructure and included ORM. I explored options to execute partial requests from Django HTML templates, without submitting requests to reload the complete page. This is possible with HTMX and Alpine.js. I thought I should share my experience with the broader Django community. I will prepare a sample CRUD app to explain the functionality, this will be styled with Tailwind CSS to look modern and usable.
