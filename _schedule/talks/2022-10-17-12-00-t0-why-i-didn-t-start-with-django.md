abstract: Learning Python is exciting. Newcomers may quickly have powerful tools at
  their disposal, and they soon want to find a "place" to put their ideas. Some may
  gravitate toward web frameworks, and as they start learning about Django, it might
  feel a little intimidating. That happened to me.

When I started learning Python, it was exciting&mdash;uncharted territory ahead. With powerful tools at my fingertips and plenty of ideas, they needed to find a place to land. A web framework, perhaps?

I bombarded my search engine with variations of "which Python framework should I use." This led me to several "batteries included" vs "microframework" comparisons, with varying degrees of usefulness.

This talk will highlight some reasons I ultimately decided to build my blog, [Python By Night](https://www.pythonbynight.com), on the backbone of FastAPI, and where I am today on my Python journey.
