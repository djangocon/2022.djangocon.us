abstract: Keeping in mind the pythonic principle that _"simple is better than complex"_
  we'll see how to implement *full-text search* in a web service using only latest
  versions of *Django* and *PostgreSQL* and we'll analyze the advantages compared
  to more complex solutions based on external services.

A **full-text search** on a website is the best way to make its **contents** easily accessible to **users** because it returns better results and is in fact used in *online search engines* or *social networks*.

The implementation of full-text search can be complex and many adopt the strategy of using **dedicated search engines** in addition to the **database**, but in most cases this strategy turns out to be a big problem of **architecture** and **performance**.

In this talk we'll see a **pythonic** way to implement full-text search on a website using only Django and PostgreSQL, taking advantage of all the **innovations** introduced in latest years, and we'll analyze the **problems** of using additional search engines with examples deriving from my experience (e.g. *djangopoject.com* or *readthedocs.org*).

Through this talk you can learn how to add a full-text search on your **website**, if it's based on **Django** and **PostgreSQL**, or you can learn how to update the search function of your website if you use other search engines.
