abstract: "Are you using technology to make the world a better place? We all have a role to play. As technologists, we have the opportunity to find solutions for complex challenges — and Django has the superpowers to meet the need. Django is used every day to bring impressive, purposeful and transformative projects to life. Calvin Hendryx-Parker, Six Feet Up CTO and AWS Community Hero, will discuss what makes a project IMPACTFUL. He’ll share examples of how Django has been used to: predict when and where lightning will strike in just seconds, map forest fire trajectory, streamline battery energy storage operations and more. "
