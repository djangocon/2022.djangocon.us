In this talk I'll share war stories in scaling Django over the last 7 years at [TechSmart], as our queries/second of peak traffic increased over time. I'll describe how we built our website originally, what problems we encountered when load started to increase, and how we reacted to gradually add more components to our architecture and increase our site's maximum load.

I'll also cover proactive performance testing techniques we use to simulate load on our Django site in advance to find bottlenecks before our customers do.
